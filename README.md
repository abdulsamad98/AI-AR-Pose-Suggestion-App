# AI-AR-Pose-Suggestion-App
**ðŸŒŸ Overview**

The AI + AR Pose Suggestion App is an innovative concept that combines Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Augmented Reality to help users strike the perfect pose for photos.

The app analyzes the environment, time of day, and activity context (fun, casual, professional) and suggests personalized poses through AR overlays of 3D models. This makes photography more engaging, creative, and dynamic â€” solving the problem of repetitive and awkward poses.

**ðŸ§© Problem Statement**

People often repeat the same poses in photos, regardless of environment or activity.

Group photos lack coordination, leading to awkward or mismatched poses.

No existing solution combines AI-driven scene recognition with real-time AR pose guidance.

**ðŸš€ Key Features**

Environment-Aware Poses: Detects whether the scene is a beach, street, landmark, or indoor setup and recommends suitable poses.

AR Overlays: 3D skeletons or models projected via AR to guide users in real time.

Activity Context: Suggests poses for fun, casual, or professional scenarios.

Group Coordination: Offers balanced, creative poses for multiple people.

Personalization (Future): Tailors pose suggestions to userâ€™s style, gender, or cultural preferences.
